About CLEyeStereoVision Sample
==============================

The CLEyeStereoVision is a simple test console application written in C++. 
It demonstrates the use of CLEyeMulticam API with OpenCV framework.

Instructions:
=============

Print the included 'CL-Eye Calibration.pdf' file and paste the paper onto a hard surface.
Once CLEyeStereoVision program is running, press 'c' and move slowly the calibration pattern 
in from of both cameras (making sure that is being seen by both cameras at the same time). 
Once this is done (for 10 seconds or so), press 'c' again to exit calibration mode.
Let the CLEyeStereoVision program complete all the calculations (may take some time).
Once the calibration calculations are doe, you'll see the calibrated camera output in 
the 'Capture Window' and the calculated object depth in the "Stereo Depth" window.
